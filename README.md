# notes on the hypergeometric functions 

This is an attempt to port, modernise, and evolve this legacy repo of mine: https://github.com/alessandrocandolini/handout_hypergeometric

Eventually, I might port back the code changes to the old repo, but for now I'm using a different repo to experiment with github action compilation of latex docs, etc.
